  What we want to do...

  Have a search bar that routes to the products page so that the user
  can search for a product in the product list and click a button to
  add that product to the pantry.

<div>
  <mat-card>
    <mat-card-title class="add-pantry-item-title">
      Add Product to Pantry

      <input matInput data-test="product_nameInput" placeholder="Search for a product">
